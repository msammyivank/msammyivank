# A Little About Me
Hello, I’m M Sammy Ivan Kurniawan! A soon to be industrial engineer that's interested in Data Analytics & Data Science. I am currently still pursuing my bachelor's degree in
Institut Teknologi Bandung Indonesia, at the same time enrolling in Data Science courses in the internet to develop and sharpen my Data Wrangling skills. I'm interested in
machine learning, deep learning, and mostly natural language processing. So far, I am adept in using Python and SQL Server to help me in my everyday data wrangling needs.
I am looking to learn Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau and Power BI.

For ones who would like to reach me, you can look up my [LinkedIn] or email me through msammyivan.k@gmail.com.
